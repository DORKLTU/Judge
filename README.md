# Judge

A better mtg draft app.

### Backend/Server Todo: 

- [ ] Generate a lobby with a link 
- [ ] Allow users to join the lobby with a link or code.
- [ ] (Optional) Server browser
- [ ] When enough users have joined the lobby a game can be started.
- [ ] Mimic the score system of the official app.
- [ ] Send a timestamp for the client to count down to (50min from now)


### Frontend/Client Todo: 

- [ ] Allow users the ability to see scoreboard.
- [ ] Users should be able to see their opponent pairing.
- [ ] Users should be able to submit scores to the judge.
- [ ] Maybe call a judge through the app?
- [ ] (Optional) upload profile picture because funny.
- [ ] Countdown timer when the games have started.

## Future Improvements:
